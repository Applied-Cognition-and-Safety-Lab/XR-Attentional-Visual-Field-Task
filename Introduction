The Attention Visual Field (AVF) task is a computerized task used to map visualspatial attention in the whole visual field (Feng and Spence, 2014). 
In this task, people need to attend to a large visual field and identify a target among 15 distractors. The target and distractors are located in eight different 
directions and two eccentricities. This laboratory task uses a rigorous paradigm setting of fixation, interval, target, mask, and response.
