# Attentional Visual Field (AVF) Task

Traditionally, an Attentional Visual Field task is developed for and conducted on a desktop computer. While completing this task, participants are instructed to keep their heads in a chinrest to ensure that the visual stimuli are displayed at the appropriate size and distance. Participants must also fixate on a central point on the screen around which the other visual stimuli are calibrated to be at certain distances from the center of the visual field. This task measures the spread of attention across the visual field by displaying targets at different locations in the visual field based on the target's direction and distance from the center of the visual field. Participants are instructed to indicate which direction the target appears in for each trial, and their accuracy and response time are used to describe the shape of their attentional visual field.

# XR Attentional Visual Field Task

This XR Attentional Visual Field Task is based on the computer-based AVF task. It has been developed to work with most VR and AR headsets by implementing the OpenXR API within the Unity3D game engine. This project uses Unity version 2020.3.7f1.
